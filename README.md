## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Load and Clean Data
1. Import the `Orders`, `People`, and `Returns` tables into your data analysis tool (Excel, Power BI, or other).
2. Perform data cleaning:
   - Handle missing values.
   - Convert data types (e.g., dates and numbers).
   - Remove any duplicate records.

### Step 2: Integrate Data
1. Join the `Orders` and `Returns` tables using `Order ID` to incorporate return data with each order.
2. Link the `People` table with the `Orders` table based on `Region` to enrich data with region information.

### Step 3: Create KPI Table
1. Define a KPI table to store essential dynamic metrics, which will be calculated using formulas or calculated fields.

**Sample KPI Table**:

| Name           | Metric                | Symbol |
|----------------|-----------------------|--------|
| Total Sales    | Sum of Sales          | üí∞     |
| Total Profit   | Sum of Profit         | üìà     |
| Total Quantity | Sum of Quantity       | üì¶     |
| Number of Orders | Count of Order ID   | üõí     |
| Profitability  | Sum of Profitability  | üíπ     |
| Average Discount | Average of Discount | üîç     |

### Step 4: Build the Dashboard
1. **Create KPIs**: Display dynamic values using the KPI table.
2. **Add Filters and Slicers**: Implement filters for `Category`, `Country`, `Segment`, and `Order Date` for flexible analysis.
3. **Visualize Data**:
   - Display total sales, profit, and other KPIs.
   - Use charts to represent sales, profit trends, and distribution.
   - Add top and bottom subcategories using bar charts.
4. **Yearly Trend Analysis**: Add line graphs to display year-over-year sales performance.

### Step 5: Generate and Interpret Insights
1. Use the visualizations and KPIs to interpret trends, segment performance, and return trends.
2. Share findings to inform strategies for improving sales, profit, and customer engagement.
